CatDrive is a fun project that displays Google Map navigation on a small screen that I attach to my motorbike.

# How to

## Hardware

You will need a ESP32-C6 (or other with BLE capabilities) with a small screen.

Mine is [ESP32-C6 1.47inch Display Development Board](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-c6-lcd-1.47.htm) from Waveshare. If you use a different screen, you will need to adapt the code to your screen.

## Software

### ESP32

- The code is built with Arduino (v2), you need to install the ESP32 board support in Arduino IDE first.
- Install the required libraries: `lvgl`
- Copy `lv_conf.h` to Arduino's libraries folder (not inside `lvgl` folder).
- Make sure the screen works by using the example sketch provided by [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47)
- Build the code and upload it to your ESP32.

### Android

Currently I make the app specificly for my Pixel 4a phone running Android 13, so most APIs are level 33 or above.

- Install Android Studio and SDK for Android 13.
- Open `android-app` folder in Android Studio.
